# Neural Networks
Neural networks are the foundation of all machine learning. What makes this network "neural" is its flexibility. A neural net is initialized with random, arbitrary parameters which can be adjusted through a learning process called backpropagation. The edges spanning every pair of neurons in adjacent layers allow information to be passed to and interact with each other.

## Feed forward
Before getting into how a neural net learns, let's first discuss how it thinks. 
## Backpropagation
# Transformers
$$
A(q,k,v)=S(\frac{k^Tq}{\sqrt{d_k}})
